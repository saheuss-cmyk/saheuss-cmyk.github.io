            <p>This is a picture I took when I was at my friend's cabin. I love to be outside in nature. I also love to be in the sun on a lake!! 
                When I have free time, one of my favorite hobbies is to go on walks and listen to music. I also like to go on walks with my family
                or friends and chat with them. I am excited for the weather to be warm again because this is my favorite hobby.</p>
